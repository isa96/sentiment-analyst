In this NLP project, we harness the capabilities of Scikit-learn and NLTK libraries to delve into sentiment analysis. 
One of the captivating projects I have undertaken involves the classification of film genres, covid vaccine and restaurant reviews, 
determining their sentiment as either positive or negative based on user feedback.
